Gallery Garbage Collector
=========================

What is this?
-------------

Is your phone storage running low? Do you need to remove a lot of old pictures and movies? Do you feel that manually selecting the items in your gallery one by one is too slow? Do you already have a backup of all your items in the cloud or on your pc?
If the answer to above questions is 'yes', then this is the app for you! The Gallery Garbage Collector will automatically look for old pictures and movies on your phone and delete them (with your confirmation).

How do I use it?
----------------

Install the app on your Android phone, select the oldest date of items you want to preserve and click clean!
The application will provide you with more information (e.g. a checkbox list of all files that will be removed and the total amount of memory that will be freed).
